*integrate gzscenic and my language*

*give better error messages*

*frequency of checking the properties can be modified in some circunstances to not check at every iteration*

*validation of the proposal (which is surprising, as the paper contains print screens of the system output). After the presentation of the rules formulation in the proposed language, the authors immediately turn into the Conclusions, without any experimental data to validate the proposal. This is certainly a major flaw of the paper as, taking into consideration what has been presented and the overall quality of the paper in other aspects (structure, quality of writing, ...), the authors could have gone a litter further in providing some evidence on the effective capabilities of their proposal. As it is, the readers only have a proposal of a language and a couple of examples of rule implementation, but no concrete evidence that the system actually detects any rule violation, when it occurs, nor that it can do so without disturbing the simulation by demanding excessive resources, for instance.*

*Integrate the language with more industrial simulators.*

*The tests could allow the robot's automatic correction and generation of code. Generating multiple alternatives and automatically evaluating how good they are, improving the code to do what we want.*
