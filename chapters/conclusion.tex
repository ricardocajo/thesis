*This is the paper conclusion*

The proposed approach can express some interesting scenarios that developers care about. We are expanding our examples to include bugs found~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/robust-rosin/robust}} in real work projects and from a survey, we are conducting with expert developers. Our development is available online~\footnote{\url{https://ricardocajo.github.io/error-monitor-ros-gazebo}} for those that want to experiment with it. We also intend on expanding the primitives with more simulator information or with the possibility of integrating sensors for supporting field testing in alternative to simulation.
