I would like to thank my coordinator, Prof. Alcides Fonseca, for the exceptional way of teaching not only through the making of my thesis but also throughout all my academic courses. 

My coordinator Prof. Chris Timperley for taking his time to help me in this chapter of his life where he had to take care of his baby. 

My upperclassman Paulo and Catarina, for all the advice and help. 

All my friends who spent time with me know that somehow you helped me through this process. 

All my family, in particular my grandparents. 

My little brother. 

In the end, and more importantly, my mother for taking care of me all my life and giving me the opportunity to follow this path.
