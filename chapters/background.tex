Brief paragraph introducing the chapter.

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source framework with a 
vast collection of libraries and tools that help build robot software. 
ROS runs on Linux Ubuntu and provides an abstraction between hardware and software.
ROS was built with the purpose of cross-collaboration, there are
packages for almost everything and no need to reinvent the wheel.
ROS is the most widely used tool for writing robot software.
Companies like Sony, LG, Rapyuta Robotics, etc., rely on ROS to deliver their products.

Robot simulation is an essential tool for testing robots behavior. 
Gazebo started with the idea of a high-fidelity simulator to simulate 
robots in outdoor environments under varied conditions.
Today it offers the ability to simulate numerous robots in complex distinct environments.
Gazebo is an open-source 3D simulator that supports sensors simulation 
and actuators control under different physics engines.
