\chapter{Monitoring}
\label{chap:monitoring}

This chapter explains the whole process of monitoring, from compilation to error detection. 

First, the overall process of compilation is explained in \autoref{sec:runtimemonitoring}, then the generated file and some of its specifications are described in \autoref{sec:generatedfile}.

\section{Runtime Monitoring}
\label{sec:runtimemonitoring}

After writing all the desired robotic systems specifications, the file needs to be compiled into a monitoring Python module. This is currently done running the following script, from its location: \lstinline{python language.py properties.txt /home/ros_workspace/src/my_pkg/src}.

The \textit{language.py} file needs to be run as a Python file and takes as arguments:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The specifications file;
    \item The path where the generated Python monitoring module will be generated.
\end{enumerate}

The given directory for the generated file should be under a ROS workspace for the compilation to succeed. This is because, during the compilation, access to information like the available ROS messages might be necessary.

The monitoring file can now run as an independent ROS node, integrated into a launch file, or using \textit{rosrun} in the console to execute it.

% Generated File
\section{Compilation} 
\label{sec:generatedfile}

This section starts by giving an overview of what the generated code does while executing (\autoref{ssec:compileArchitecture}), next the data structures used in compilation and the translation rules to the generated code are explained (\autoref{ssec:compileCtx}), how the various states of the simulation are saved is discussed in \autoref{ssec:compileState}, and finally the generation of error messages is talked about in \autoref{ssec:errormessages}. 

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Architecture}
\label{ssec:compileArchitecture}

The next diagram (\autoref{fig:gencodediag}) tries to capture the essence of what the generated code is doing when running alongside a simulation of a robotic system. The Diagram highlights the two parallel processes running in the node, the "Callback Function" and the "Monitoring Loop" and their job in the verification.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics{images/gen_code_diagram.pdf}
\caption{Diagram of the execution of the generated code.} \label{fig:gencodediag}
\end{figure}

The node executes a loop at a delineated rate, doing the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Check if the defined simulation timeout time has been reached.
    \item Save the current simulation state in a global variable of saved states.
    \item Verify the properties using the saved states and calling each dedicated property function.
\end{enumerate}


% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Runtime Monitoring
\subsection{Code Generation}
\label{ssec:compileCtx}

In order to generate the monitoring code, some context is saved when parsing through the abstract syntax tree created from the specification file.

The saved context is essentialy separated in five Dictionary lists: \nameref{sssec:compileModels}, \nameref{sssec:compileAssoc}, \nameref{sssec:compileVars}, \nameref{sssec:compileSubs}, and \nameref{sssec:compileProp}.

The information saved in these data structures will afterward be used in translation rules between the source code to create the generated code.


% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Runtime Monitoring
\subsubsection{Models}
\label{sssec:compileModels}

The data structure of each model saved in the context is composed of:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The name during the execution of the object in the simulation that is being modeled.
    \item The correspondent function the model refers to, for example \textit{velocity} or \textit{distance}.
    \item The Message type of the data structure of the \textit{topic} to subscribe.
\end{enumerate}

For each entry in the \textit{Model} of an object: A model data structure will be saved in the context. And a subscriber data structure will be created that will subscribe to the correspondent \textit{topic} of the modeled object.

The subscriber and variable that fetches the subscriberâ€™s value in the correspondent generated code that is associated with each entry, will have a unique name composed of the object name plus the function associated with that entry.


% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Runtime Monitoring
\subsubsection{Associations}
\label{sssec:compileAssoc}

The data structure of each association saved in the context is composed of:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The name of the association in the specification.
    \item The name of the variable associated with the association.
\end{enumerate}

When specifying an association a new variable data structure is created in the context. The new variable has the prefix of an association as well as its name. In the generated code the new variable will point to the variable created on the right side of the association.


% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Runtime Monitoring
\subsubsection{Variables}
\label{sssec:compileVars}

The data structure of each variable saved in the context is composed of:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The variable name to use in generated code.
    \item The generated code representation of the expression to be used to fetch the data of the variable.
\end{enumerate}

The variable names to be used in the generated code will have different suffixes and prefixes depending on: Their types, and if they originate from a model, declaration, function, or association. In this way, it is easier to identify variable relations during the compilation of the generated code.

All simulation primitives have a hardcoded representation to get their absolute value from the simulator \textit{topic} information, which is stored in a global \textit{state} variable (\autoref{ssec:compileState}). To retrieve the correct string for each primitive to be used in the generated code, an auxiliary function \textit{sim\_funcs} was created:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    def sim_funcs(object_, func, args, ctx):
    """Add var to the context and return var name for the output file (Considering the function used)"""
    var_name, extract = None, None
    if func == "position":
        args = ["position"] + args
        var_name = object_ + "_" + "_".join(args) + "_var_sim"
        extract = (
            "model_states_msg.pose[model_states_indexes['"
            + object_
            + "']]."
            + ".".join(args)
        )
    elif func == "velocity":
        var_name = object_ + "_velocity_" + "_".join(args) + "_var_sim"
        if args == []:
            extract = (
                "((model_states_msg.twist[model_states_indexes['"
                + object_
                + "']].linear.x)**2 + (model_states_msg.twist[model_states_indexes['"
                + object_
                + "']].linear.y)**2 + (model_states_msg.twist[model_states_indexes['"
                + object_
                + "']].linear.z)**2"
                + ")**(0.5)"
            )
        else:
            extract = (
                "model_states_msg.twist[model_states_indexes['"
                + object_
                + "']]."
                + ".".join(args)
            )
    elif func == "localization_error":
        var_name = object_ + "_localization_error"
        args = ctx.model_msgtype(object_, "position")
        extract = (
            "((model_states_msg.pose[model_states_indexes['"

        )
    elif func == "distanceZ":
        object2 = args[0]
        var_name = object_ + "_" + object2 + "_distanceZ"
        extract = (
            "((model_states_msg.pose[model_states_indexes['"

    ctx.add_var(var_name, extract)
    return "states[0]['" + var_name + "']"
\end{lstlisting}

% Runtime Monitoring
\subsubsection{Subscribers}
\label{sssec:compileSubs}

The data structure of each subscriber saved in the context is composed of:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \textit{Topic} name to which to subscribe.
    \item The Message type associated with the \textit{topic}.
    \item The Library from which the Message type originates
    \item The Subscriber name in the generated code
\end{enumerate}

A subscriber relates in the specification to a \textit{declaration}, a \textit{model} entry, or the default simulator information \textit{topic}.

The Library is necessary in order to make an import of the Message type in the generated code. The Library is obtained through a python subprocess:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    command = f"cd {self.filepath} | rosmsg show {msg_type}"
\end{lstlisting}

The generated monitoring file declares the needed subscribers and uses ApproximateTimeSynchronizer to call the callback function. The ApproximateTimeSynchronizer synchronizes messages by their timestamp and if they do not have a header, uses the ROS time.


% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Runtime Monitoring
\subsubsection{Properties}
\label{sssec:compileProp}

The data structure of each property saved in the context is composed of:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The correspondent line in the specification file.
    \item The correspondent type of property.
    \item A List of Strings with the necessary code representation of boolean assertions to be used in the generated code as a property verification.
\end{enumerate}


A property is represented by one base property, which is the one at the first level of the specification. In the next example (\nameref{lstlisting:compileEx}), the base property saved in the context will be the "after". The "never" property will only influence the way the property is checked on the generated code and no data structure of it will be saved in the context.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    after robot.distance.wall < 1, never robot.velocity > 0.5
\end{lstlisting}\label{lstlisting:compileEx}

A property, in order of complexity, is comprised of: Other properties, conjunctions (\textit{and}, \textit{or}, and \textit{implies}), comparisons (\textit{<}, \textit{>}, \textit{<=}, \textit{>=}, \textit{==}, and \textit{!=}), operations (\textit{+}, \textit{-}, \textit{*}, and \textit{/}), and operands (variable, number, boolean, simulation primitive, and temporal value). 

The abstract syntax tree is parsed from the lowest to the highest complexity field, in this way the List of strings that represent boolean assertions in the generated code can be accumulatively built because the information from the lowest fields is always present in the higher ones. In the end, a List with the necessary comparisons is built for a base property.

%self.eventually = 0
%self.eventually\_aux = 0
%self.is\_after = False

In the generated code an independent function with the necessary boolean assertions for verifying the property will then be defined for each base property.

\subsection{State}
\label{ssec:compileState}

A callback function is called every time a new message from one of the subscribers is received. The callback function saves the relevant information for property checking in a global variable as a Dictionary. This information serves as a current "screenshot" of the simulation representing its current state.

The callback function is called at fluctuating rates, for this reason, we take advantage of the loop that is running at a fixed rate to save multiple current states of the simulation in another global variable as a Dictionary List. This variable will be the one used when checking the properties to make correlations with past states.


% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Error Messages
\subsection{Error Messages}
\label{ssec:errormessages}

An error message starts by stating the line in the specification file which resulted in an error as well as showing the property where the error originated.

Afterward, I use the current saved state of the simulation to show the values at the time of failure of all the variables present in the property that originated the error.
